# Newspack Disqus AMP Integration

This plugin provides a Disqus comment form on AMP pages. The plugin is intended to be used with the official Disqus WordPress plugin and the official AMP plugin active, and will not work correctly if unofficial versions of those plugins are used. If those plugins are configured and active, there is no extra configuration needed to use this plugin. This plugin can be installed through the Plugins screen of your site in the list of Newspack-managed plugins.
